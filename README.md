# Image-Filter-Convolution-CUDA-OpenGL-OpenCV
This repository contains code for an implementation of convolution filtering of images either stored in files or acquired from a camera.

The convolution filters are optimized 2D CUDA stencils.

File IO and benchmarking are provided by calls to the OpenCV library.

Image display is provided by interoperating CUDA with OpenCV.

To compile the code run the makefile.
